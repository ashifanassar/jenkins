# jenkins

We are going to place the learning of our Jenkins starting from basics to advanced in this repository



# Backlog 

```
    Configure a webHook between Jenkins and GitHub.
    So that when there is any commit on xyz-repo, jenins-xyx would be triggered automatically.
```


Imp : Stages on jenkins are sequential, that means stage 2 will only run after the completion of stage-1 


Jenkins is all about plugins ?
A plug-in is nothing but a feature, if you want a feature, install that plugin.
